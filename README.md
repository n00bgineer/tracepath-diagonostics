# Tracepath Diagnostic Server

This repository contains the diagnostic server for the Tracepath application. The **diagnostic server** generates the report (i.e. visual tracerouting, performance reports using lighthouse on a headless chromium browser, etc) on a cloud instance deployed in a particular region & is built using Express Generator, a popular Node.js framework for building web applications.

## Manual setup

## Getting Started

To set up the diagnostic server locally, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (LTS)
  ```
  node -v
  ```
- npm (Node Package Manager)

  ```
  npm -v
  ```

- traceroute
  ```
  sudo apt-get install traceroute
  ```
- Chromium/Chrome browser

  ```
  sudo apt install -y chromium-browser
  ```

### Installation

```
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/n00bgineer/tracepath-diagonostics.git ./diagonostic

# Change into the project directory
cd diagnostic

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

### Configuration

The server requires a configuration file to run properly. Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project and define the following environment variables:

```
PORT=3000 # The port on which the server should listen
```

### Starting the Server
