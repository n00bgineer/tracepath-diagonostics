# Tracepath Diagnostic Server

**Tracepath** is an open-source application for performance and security monitoring. Currently, for any given web application's URL (e.g., pangea.cloud), it generates a report consisting of two parts:

1. **Performance analysis**, which contains the web application's performance report generated against one of Tracepath's diagnostic servers. These servers run on a cloud instance deployed at a specific location (e.g., Mumbai, Stockholm). The performance analysis is conducted using Google's `lighthouse` tool running on a headless Chrome browser. However, unlike a typical Lighthouse report, Tracepath presents the performance metrics in a jargon-free form that can be easily understood by non-technical stakeholders of a project.

2. **Security tracerouting**, a unique feature offered by Tracepath, helps visualize the routing path of packets along with their geographic location and IP reputation score to identify malicious IP addresses through which the IP packets might be passing. It combines tracerouting, IP geolocation, and IP threat/reputation intelligence.

This repository contains the code for the **diagnostic server** of Tracepath. The **diagnostic server** is responsible for generating the report (i.e. security tracerouting, performance reports using lighthouse on a headless chromium browser, etc) on a cloud instance deployed in a particular region, which is consumed by the [application client & server](https://github.com/n00bgineer/tracepath) & is built using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework for building server applications.

## Pangea API usage

Curently, two API endpoints of Pangea have been used to implement the security tracerouting feature, which is a combination of IP geolocation & IP threat/reputation score:
1. IP (Reputation) Geolocation Endpoint
2. IP (Reputation) Reputation Endpoint

## Getting Started

To set up the diagnostic server locally, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (LTS)
  ```
  node -v
  ```
- npm (Node Package Manager)

  ```
  npm -v
  ```

- traceroute
  ```
  sudo apt-get install traceroute
  ```
- Chromium/Chrome browser

  ```
  sudo apt install -y chromium-browser
  ```

### Installation

```
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/n00bgineer/tracepath-diagonostics.git ./diagonostic

# Change into the project directory
cd diagnostic

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

### Configuration

The server requires a configuration file to run properly. Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project and define the following environment variables:

```
PORT=3000 # The port on which the server should listen
```

### Starting the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

The server will start running on the specified port (default: 3000). You can access it via http://localhost:3000.

## Automated Setup (Setup)

ðŸš§ TBD

## API Endpoints

The diagnostic server provides the following API endpoints:

```
GET /api/status: Check if the server is running and responsive.
POST /api/report: Submit a report generation request to the server.
```

## API Documentation

For detailed information about each endpoint and how to use them, refer to the API documentation. The documentation is available at http://localhost:3000/api-docs when the server is running.
